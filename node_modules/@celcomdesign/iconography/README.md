# Prisma Icons

## Quick start

The *index.html* list all the icons available.

### SVG icons

The *SVG* folder contains the icons as separate SVG files.

## Usage

### External image

Copy the Prisma Icons SVGs to your directory of choice and reference them like normal images with the `<img>` element.

`<img src="./svg/logo/logo-celcom-life.svg" alt="" width="32" height="32" title="Celcom Life"/>`

### Sprite

If you prefer using SVG sprites, it's available in *sprite* folder. To insert your icons as inline SVGs (with the `<use>` element), copy the `<svg>` element (that contains symbol definitions) from the source of the index.html file, below your own HTML's `<body>` tag. After copying this SVG, you can reference your glyphs like the following:

`<svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" width="32" height="32"><use xlink:href="./sprite/prisma-icons.symbol.svg#home-dashboard"></use></svg>`

It's currently limited to normal icons, colored icons and expressive icons only.

## Known issues

### To do

A lot of manual work currently. Will need to automate most of the things.

Current publishing method : 

`npm run publish -> npm run svgtofont -> copy HTML codes manually`
